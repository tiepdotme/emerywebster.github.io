It's been over three years since my last big update (a common mark of getting hired and then neglecting personal design/dev projects) â€“ so it's cool to document such a jump in my toolset around front end development.

While the overall layout and design is largely the same, there are a lot of under-the-hood improvements that I'm especially proud of:

{: .list-disc .list-inside .pl-10 }
- Moved from Bootstrap to TailwindCSS
- Set up a deploy script for GitHub Pages
- Removed unnecessary asset builds (performance improvement)
